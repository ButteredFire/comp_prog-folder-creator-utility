# Competitive progamming folder creator utility
This is a (modifiable) folder creator utility for competitive programming (Creates folders with code templates). It provides an intuitive interface for those who are not familiar with create/copy/paste commands or dislike manual copy-pasting. The utility aims to reduce setup time and streamline coding in a competitive environment, where every second counts.
Out of the box, this utility only supports CodeForces and LQDOJ, but if you know Python, you can implement a specific functionality/feature for another platform (for instance, CodeForces support the creation of multiple folders - A B C D E F, etc. - that correspond to the nature of how problems on CodeForces contests are usually listed and named)
